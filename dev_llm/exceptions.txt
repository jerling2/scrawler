You are reviewing and improving a Python file by polishing exceptions and logging.
It is important that you only modify lines that are either exceptions or loggging.

EXCEPTION HANDLING:
- Replace general exceptions with specific ones (e.g., ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)
- Use Exception as a base class only when no specific exception applies
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions for custom exceptions
- Ensure exception messages are clear and actionable

LOGGING:
- Keep all log messages under 100 characters
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Follow consistent formatting across log statements
- Include relevant context without exceeding character limit

GRAMMAR & STYLE:
- Fix all grammar mistakes in comments, docstrings, and messages
- Use consistent punctuation and capitalization
- Follow Pythonic conventions (PEP 8, PEP 257)
- Ensure technical accuracy in terminology

Apply these rules consistently throughout the file while maintaining code functionality.
